  ## Usage
  
Change directories to your new project folder in the terminal. Invoke the application by typing "node index.js" or by typing the script "npm start" in the terminal's command line. You will be asked a series of questions before your logo is generated. If you do not enter a valid color keyword or hexadecimal number, you will be prompted to try again. If your text contains more than 3 characters, you will be prompted to try again. Once all prompts have been answered with accepted values, your new logo will be generated with the file name 'logo.svg' in the 'examples' folder. Refer back to the video posted in the description as needed.
